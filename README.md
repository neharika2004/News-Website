## Overview

This News Website is a simple and lightweight web application that fetches news articles from a third-party API and displays them to the user. The technologies used in building this project include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The combination of these technologies provides a responsive and interactive user interface for browsing news articles.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The website offers a clean and intuitive interface for users to easily navigate and read news articles.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web pages is created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), providing the foundation for the content.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for styling the web pages, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design.

- **JavaScript:** The website utilizes JavaScript to interact with the API, dynamically update the content, and provide a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

## Configuration

If you want to use a different API as a news source, you can modify the API endpoint in the JavaScript file (`script.js`). Look for the variable that holds the API endpoint and update it accordingly.

```javascript
const apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/news';
```
